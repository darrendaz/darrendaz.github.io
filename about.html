<p>Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness. A human being is primarily a bag for putting food into; the other functions and faculties may be more godlike, but in point of time they come afterward. A man dies and is buried, and all his words and actions are forgotten, but the food he has eaten lives after him in the sound or rotten bones of his children. I think it could be plausibly argued that changes of diet are more important than changes of dynasty or even of religion....Yet it is curious how seldom the all-importance of food is recognized. You see statues everywhere to politicians, poets, bishops, but none to cooks or bacon-curers or market gardeners.
